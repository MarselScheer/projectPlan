# Introduction

The columns *id* is used to identify tasks in the work plan. It is not necessary to specify
the *id* but this allows to declare dependencies between
tasks. There can be logic dependencies where a task cannot start if another has not been finished, for instance
first comes the fundament, then the walls and then the roof. Other tasks may need to be executed
sequentially simply because because there are not enough resources.
For illustration purpose, we will create very small project plans, that focus on the corresponding aspect 
under considerations.

# *id* not unique 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pA <- dplyr::tibble(
  project = c("A"), 
  section = c("0_prep", "1_design"), task = paste0("task", 1:2), id = paste0("i", 1:2), start = NA, depends_on = "", deadline = NA,
  est_duration = 1:2,
  progress = 0, 
  resource = "R1",
  status = NA,
  end = NA,
  microtasks = "-",
  comments = "-")
```

The intrinsic property of an *id* is that it is unique. Note, if *id* is not provided, then entries of the form *NOT_SPECIFIED_#some_digit#*
are generated automatically. One should avoid to use those entries to specify dependencies because it is very likely that the
automatically generated digit-suffix will change. Internally, the *id*-entry is combined with the project name.
Therefore, if the same *id* is used in different projects it is unique.
However, especially at the beginning of a project when the plan is growing it could be handy to have one id for more than one tasks. 
Using the same *id* within the same *section* is possible. If this happens, then the corresponding rows are combined
together into one entry, i.e.:

* all entries in columns *depends_on, resource, task* are concatenated
* mean of the progress column is calculated
* minimum of the deadlines is calculated
* sum of the estimated days necessary is calculated
* if start and end date are given, then minimum of start and maximum of the end date are used for the combined entry
* if any task is in status waiting, then the combined entry also gets a waiting status

Note that using the same *id* in different *sections* results in a warning

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pA$id <- "i1"
DT::datatable(pA)
```

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
pA %>% 
  projectPlan::wrangle_raw_plan() %>% 
  projectPlan::calculate_time_lines() %>% 
  projectPlan::gantt_by_sections()
```

# Logic dependencies

Logic dependency, e.g. first walls then roof, can be specified using the *depends_on* column. 
Note that *task2* has no *start*-entry this is important because if the *start*-entry is set,
then this is considered as the start date of that task, irrespective of its dependency.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pA$id <- "i1"
pA$section <- "prep"
pA$id <- paste0("i", 1:2)
pA$depends_on[2] <- "i1"
pA$start[2] <- ""
DT::datatable(pA)
```

In order to see this logic dependency (arrow from one task to another) one has to set the parameter *show_dependencies* to 
*TRUE*:

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
pA %>% 
  projectPlan::wrangle_raw_plan() %>% 
  projectPlan::calculate_time_lines() %>% 
  projectPlan::gantt_by_sections(show_dependencies = TRUE)
```

Instead of stating the dependcy directly one could simply use the term *PREVIOUS*. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pA$depends_on[2] <- "PREVIOUS"
DT::datatable(pA)
```

However, if one inserts a new task between task1 and task2, then of course task2 
depends on the new task and not anymore on task1.

# Non-Logic dependencies

If a task should start after some other tasks one can use the *start*-column and simply
enter the *id* after which the current task should be positioned:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pA$depends_on[2] <- ""
pA$start[2] <- "i1"
DT::datatable(pA)
```

In this case the gantt chart do not show an arrow even if the parameter *show_dependencies* is set to *TRUE*:

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
pA %>% 
  projectPlan::wrangle_raw_plan() %>% 
  projectPlan::calculate_time_lines() %>% 
  projectPlan::gantt_by_sections(show_dependencies = TRUE)
```


Again, instead of stating the dependcy directly one could simply use the term *PREVIOUS*. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pA$depends_on[2] <- ""
pA$start[2] <- "PREVIOUS"
DT::datatable(pA)
```


# Dependencies between different projects

As stated at the beginning, internally, the *id* is combined with the project name. For instance, *id = i1* in
project *A* is internally stored as *A::i1*. This is also the reason why *id = i1* can be used in project *A* and
*B* at the same time without any conflicts. In order to define that a task depends on another task of a different 
project one has to specify the 'whole' id, that is *projectname::id*.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pA <- dplyr::tibble(
  project = c("A"), 
  section = "prep", task = paste0("task", 1:2), id = paste0("i", 1:2), start = NA, depends_on = "", deadline = NA,
  est_duration = 1:2,
  progress = 0, 
  resource = "R1",
  status = NA,
  end = NA,
  microtasks = "-",
  comments = "-")

pB <- pA
pB$project = "B"

pp <- dplyr::bind_rows(pA, pB)

pp$depends_on[1] = "B::i1"
pp$depends_on[2] = "i1"
pp$start[1:2] = NA
DT::datatable(pp)
```

Again, note that start is not specified for tasks that depend on other tasks, otherwise the entry in start would
override the start date that is implicitly defined by the dependencies.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
pp %>% 
  projectPlan::wrangle_raw_plan() %>% 
  projectPlan::calculate_time_lines() %>% 
  projectPlan::gantt_by_sections(show_dependencies = TRUE)
```
